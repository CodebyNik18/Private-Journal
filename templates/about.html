        <h2>What is Personal Journal?</h2>
        <p>
            Personal Journal is a private web application where users can safely write,
            store, and manage their personal thoughts. Each journal entry belongs only
            to its creator, ensuring privacy and ownership by design.
        </p>
        <p>
            The platform focuses on simplicity and clarity, avoiding unnecessary
            features so users can concentrate on writing and reflection.

        <h2>Purpose of the Project</h2>
        <p>
            This project is built as a long-term learning application using Django.
            Instead of relying on APIs or frontend-heavy frameworks, the goal is to
            deeply understand backend fundamentals such as authentication, database
            relationships, permissions, and user-specific data handling.
        </p>
        <p>
            It serves both as a personal learning journey and a foundation for building
            real-world Django applications.
        </p>

        <h2>How Privacy is Handled</h2>
        <p>
            Every journal entry is strictly associated with a single authenticated user.
            Users can only create, view, edit, or delete their own entries. No shared
            content, no public feeds, and no external access.
        </p>
        <p>
            This approach reflects the core philosophy of the project — privacy first.
        </p>

        <h2>Technology Used</h2>
        <p>
            The application is built entirely using Django, with server-rendered pages
            and traditional form handling. No external APIs are used, making the system
            easy to understand, maintain, and extend.
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML and CSS are used to create a clean, distraction-free interface that
            complements the writing experience.
        </p>

        <h2>Long-Term Vision</h2>
        <p>
            This project is intended to grow gradually. Future enhancements may include
            richer writing tools, better organization, and performance improvements —
            all while keeping the interface minimal and the user experience focused.
        </p>
        <p>
            The aim is not complexity, but clarity.
